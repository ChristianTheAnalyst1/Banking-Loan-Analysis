# PROBLEM STATEMENT

# DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:**

1. Total Loan Applications: calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).


2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze the MoM changes in this metric.


3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. Analyze the MTD Total Amount Received and observe the MoM changes.


4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the MoM variations in interest rates to provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.


5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.
